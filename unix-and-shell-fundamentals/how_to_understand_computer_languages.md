# How to Understand Computer Languages

A programming language is a program which takes text (represented as a
"string" of characters) and *interprets* it to produce some sort of
value or side effect.

In order to understand a computer programming language you need to build
a model of this process in your mind. The process of transforming text
into values and actions is called "evaluation" or "interpretation" in
the lingo of computer science and as we learn to get around in the shell
we will need to accumulate a set of "evaluation rules" in our mind. The
more rules we accumulate the more we will understand shell scripting.

When we get to learning R and Python the same process will apply.

Now, letâ€™s dive into the shell itself: ::introduction_to_unix_shells:Introduction to Unix Shells::
