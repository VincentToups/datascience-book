# Linux Distributions

The most popular Unix-like operating systems are Linux and OSX. That
would seem simple enough except that Linux is an umbrella which covers a
huge variety of Unix-like operating systems. In fact, Linux technically
refers *just* to the so-called "kernel" of the operating system - the
basic software that intermediates between the computer hardware and the
user. But the kernel alone is not typically enough to make a functional
computer, so a set of utilities (often drawn from something called the
GNU Project) provides the basic utilities (including but not limited to
things like the commands listed in the previous section). But even Linux
and the GNU System together don't constitute a useful system (for most
cases). Additional tools and conventions are layered on top to form a
"distribution" of Linux.

There are hundreds of actively developed Linux distributions although
the number left over after you eliminate those distributions which are
largely similar, based on the same set of tools, would be smaller. As of
the time of this writing some of the more popular linux distributions
are Arch, Ubuntu, Mint and CentOS/Rocky Linux.

Next, weâ€™ll cover package managers across variants: ::linux_package_managers:Linux Variants and Package Managers::
