Imagine the SCENE!

Goofus presents a poster at Comic Book Data Science in August of 2025
where he presents a result: using a state of the art classifier he is
able to correctly predict the gender of a super hero character based
on their power levels.

How shows an AUC of 0.74, which is respectable, suggesting that super
powers are distributed differently across gender in superheroes.

In August of 2026 he publishes the paper and the same figure shows a
result of 0.61, a substantially less successful classifier.

A colleague emails him to ask what changed between 2024 and 2024 and
Goofus really has no idea. Why? Because his code is just a pile of
directories and files. In fact, he hasn't worked on it in 6 months and
may not be able to reproduce the published figure exactly, to say
nothing of the figure from 2025.

Eventually he convinces himself he has found the right version of the
code and gets it running again and it still fails to exactly match the
published result.

How can Goofus purport to be a scientist when he cannot even
demonstrate how the figures he created were produced?

Indeed, Goofus's inability to reproduce his results triggers a wave of
fraud accusations which sweep through the Comic Book Data Science
world, disrupting careers and lives.
