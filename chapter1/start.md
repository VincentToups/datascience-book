Welcome and Front Matter
------------------------

Welcome to BIOS 611 - Intro to Data Science.

Let's talk about how this course works!

First of all, we meet twice a week, Monday and Wednesday, with labs
on Tuesday.

Class is in McGavran-Greenberg Hall - 1301 from 3:35pm to 4:50pm.
Lab is usually at 2pm but presently I don't have the room assignment.

How the Course Works
--------------------

The course notes are written in this repository. They are "markdown" documents
and they are meant to be rendered by this book software which I created for the
course.

Grading
-------

This course is project based, so most of your grade (50%) is based on your 
final project (the details of which we will discuss soon and in great detail many
times). And then 25% will be in class participation and 25% will be 
homeworks, which are given about once a week.

AI
--

I want us all to sit with the idea that in your lifetime we have made this huge
transition: before a few years ago if you wanted to talk with something it HAD
to be a person. Now we have these AIs. Crazy, right?

Anyway, I let people use AI in this course because, as far as I can tell, they
can't reall help you. AI can write code but I'm still very sure that it can't really
understand it.

Data Science, more than most disciplines which require coding, is about glueing
stuff together. So AI is more useful, perhaps, here. But data science is way
more about understanding what is happening than writing code, so it can't help
you with that. 

I recommend asking AI's why a lot and being skeptical. If you wany my real
advice: write code by hand for awhile. It will help you learn.

```sidebar
In my experience AI doesn't really eliminate any of the things you need to be an effective developer - you still need to know what tools to use, how they work, and what you want to do with them. AI just lets you move over this material faster in some situations, but, so far, it cannot even liberate you from needing to know what you are doing. 
```
So you can use AI to write code, but I will still expect you to demonstrate
understanding of the code if I ask you about it in class.
