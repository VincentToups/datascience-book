Containerization
================

This is the short version. A Container is just the tech buzzword for what you
can think of as a "virtual computer."

Docker/Podman (which basically I am going to use interchangeably as far as casual
nomenclature is concerned) solve the following problem:

When we have a data analysis it has to take place in a specific _context_. It needs
software libraries installed, basically. And these setups can be quite elaborate
and even brittle. Before containers we'd pass around complicated documents
describing exactly how to get a system configured to do an analysis.

You'd try to do this, but then you'd make a mistake halfway through and that would
break your system or leave it in a weird state without any easy way to undo
it. Maybe you'd get it working but it wouldn't give the same results, etc, etc.

It sucks.

Containers allow us to _describe_ the environment we need to do an analysis. The
system then _builds_ that environment (or pulls it from the cloud) and we work
in that container. This has huge benefits. If we screw up our Container it's no
big deal. We can throw it away and rebuild it. It also protects our host operating
system from any messes we might make in the container.

Using containers we can maintain separate environments for each project, even.
This is a huge improvement. 

Docker is the biggest commercial container system, so we call these files that 
describe our system "Dockerfiles". A simple Dockerfile might look like this:

```Dockerfile 
FROM rocker/verse

RUN R -e "install.packages('plotly')"

```

The Dockerfile (also called a Containerfile if you want to stick it to the man)
for this book looks like this:

```Dockerfile file="/fs/book/nvidia.Containerfile"

To really understand what a Dockerfile says, we need to know a little Unix. We'll get there.
But Docker is also really handy because you can use it to just start a Unix shell to experiment
with for the early parts of this course and you can be sure you won't screw 
up your host system.
