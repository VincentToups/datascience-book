How Code is Integrated into this Book
=====================================

This class will involve writing a lot of code.

```sidebar
Even though nowadays AI writes a lot of code for us, a good text editor
and the knowledge of how to use it is still indespendible.
```

Code appears in our book in blocks like this:

```r 
cat("Hello World!!!\n")

```
A major part of this course pertains to _how_ we organize our code and thus
we want to sometimes talk about specific _files_ with specific code in them.

We can do that easily here:

```r file=example.R
cat("This is a code block which corresponds to a file.\n")
```
