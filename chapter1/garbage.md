A Nightmarish Sargasso of Floating Garbage
==========================================

There are basically two distinct sets of skills for data scientists. 

1. How to navigate and exploit the vast array of tools, data sources, programming languages and other stuff that holds all this data
2. How to use data analytic methods to extract insights from the data. This includes all the data-sciency material in the syllabus: clustering, classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and visualization.

A Pitch For Regular Scientists
==============================

Some of you are regular scientists.

:genimg:a totally regular scientist using a computer for research (note, scientists can be women)::

Science!
--------

Science, as we all know, is a linear process more or less consisting of this
set of events:

<svg id="statisticians"></svg>

```javascript browser
import {renderArcDiagram} from "/js/d3util.js"

console.log("Exec block.")
renderArcDiagram("statisticians","Design Experiment Data Analysis Claims".split(" "),
	[["Design","Experiment"],
     ["Experiment","Data"],
	 ["Data","Analysis"],
	 ["Analysis","Claims"]],
	{"width":0.99999, "height":120})

```
Then we publish and our review comes back clean and we get the next grant
and we're famous. We never wept in graduate school it was a totally cool
and normal time which didn't ruin on relationships and lives.

:next:real_science:Of course its usually not like that.::
