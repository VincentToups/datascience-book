What is a Data Scientist?
=========================

I've had a lot of time to think about this question since starting this job.
I used to joke that a data scientist is just a statistician without 
reason or accountability, but I have a more serious answer now.

Computers
---------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC

The ENIAC was a digital computer, constructed in 1945. This may seem a bit 
obvious but computers are built to _do stuff_.

As a side effect of _doing stuff_ computers _generate data_. You may have noticed
that computers have penetrated into every single aspect of our lives since 
ENIAC in 1945 and that means that everywhere around you, as a side effect of doing
useful and not-so-useful things, good things and evil things, an ever growing
quantity of data is being produced. 

Statistics
----------

Statisticians study data too, but the history of statistics comes before
the advent of computing and one of the constants of that bygone era was
that data was _sparse_, hard to come by. Thus the bread and butter of statistics
was, in some sense, the question: how do we extract truth claims from relatively
small amounts of data. A secondary question of large importance: given that data
is hard to come by, how do we design experiments to produce the maximum amount
of useful information with the smallest amount of effort. Thus we enter
the world of, for example, the double-blind randomized clinical trial. 

There are plenty of situations where this is still of critical importance.

```csv file=data-data.csv
year,data_generated,change_over_previous_year,change_over_previous_year_pct
2010,2,,
2011,5,3,150
2012,6.5,1.5,30
2013,9,2.5,38.46
2014,12.5,3.5,38.89
2015,15.5,3,24
2016,18,2.5,16.13
2017,26,8,44.44
2018,33,7,26.92
2019,41,8,24.24
2020,64.2,23.2,56.59
2021,79,14.8,23.05
2022,97,18,22.78
2023,120,23,23.71
2024,147,27,22.5
2025,181,34,23.13
```

```r file=plot-data-data.R
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
df <- readr::read_csv("data-data.csv")

# Create plot
p <- ggplot2::ggplot(df, ggplot2::aes(x = year, y = data_generated)) +
    ggplot2::geom_line() +
    ggplot2::geom_point() +
    ggplot2::labs(
        title = "Data Generated by Year",
        x = "Year",
        y = "Data Generated (zettabytes)"
    ) +
    ggplot2::theme_minimal()

ggmd(p)
```

Data Science
------------

On the other hand, the data scientist is mostly concerned with the question:

WHAT DO WE DO WITH ALL THIS DATA!? Especially pertinent is that the data is a 
gosh darn mess. Just absolutely crud. Most of this data was generated as a side effect
of other processes. It isn't constructed to support inference. 

So the data scientist operates in a different mode: we dig in the data, crawl around
in the garbage, try to build models and see what correlates with what, primarily
to the end of generating _questions_.

Once we have questions we might work with a statistician (that statistician might be us)
to design a rigorous experiment to determine an answer.  But the hope is that
by digging around in enough data we can do something useful with it.

:genimg:nightmarish unctuous (but well lit) sewer of floating garbage::

Thus the data scientist is an explorer of the data-sphere. The data sphere is, 
for the most part, a ::garbage:nightmarish sewer of floating garbage::.
