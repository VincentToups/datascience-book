It is crazy that openai still lets you generate images with dall-e. It is really
bad!

“Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. It’s the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart. The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them.”

-Brian Eno

I like to perform a mental exercise from time to time. We can all easily roll
back the present to the last 10 seconds or so. Ten seconds ago felt pretty real,
right?

But if we repeat that process 122811660 times we are supposed to believe that
that moment, which is the lifetime of Aristarchus (~-310 BCE), a guy who figured out that
the universe is really big, is physically contiguous with us.

It seems implausible right?




Anyway, the terminal is an interesting example of a technology which makes
this process of moving through the past really clear. 

```bash 
echo "Believe it or not this object is continuous with the telegraph."
```
