Data Science
============

We are going to cover the standard suite of methods in this course. 

The basic idea behind _all exploratory data analysis_ is that given any
data set there is less than meets the eye in it. That is to say,
when we do dimensionality reduction we are saying

"I can represent this data with fewer numbers than it started with"

when we do clustering we say

"I can represent this data as a small set of clusters which are characterized by a few
numbers or properties"

When we do regression we are saying

"One variable in our data is actually representable as a combination of other variables"

and this is true for classification as well (which is just regression with a discrete
variable).

Even though it's complicated, model selection and characterization is just detail
work we need to do to choose specific representations given some criteria. That 
is it: ALL DATA SCIENCE IS SUMMARIZATION.

We will start with ::dimensionality_reduction:dimensionality reduction::.
