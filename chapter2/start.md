Lecture 2
=========

An overview of the tools we will use in the course.

Think of this as a high level overview of the tools we will use in the class
so that its not so overwhelming when we cover them in detail.

Technical Tools
---------------

These tools are:

1. the unix/linux shell
2. bash (a shell scripting language)
3. Docker/Podman Containers (little temporary computers)
4. make (a build system, it controls how your analysis runs)
5. R (a statistical programming language)
6. Python (a general purpose programming language)
7. SQL (a programming language just for querying databases)
8. Markdown, Latex (ways of authoring results)

Data Science Related Stuff
--------------------------

1. dimensionality reduction (how get a look at data with our little 2d brains)
2. clustering (how to find groups in data)
3. regression and classification (if you know the groups, how do you assign a point to them)
4. visualization with ggplot (how to make good visualizations)
5. model selection

We are going to try and do all these things by constructing a project as we go.
But today we are just going to give a brief introduction to all these ideas.

Starting with the :next:shell:the unix/linux shell::.
