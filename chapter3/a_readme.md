A readme is just a file which by convention everyone will look at 
when they load your repo. In fact, GitHub will render your readme
to HTML and show it on the home page of your repo, so it's important.

Let's create a README.

It will look like this:

```markdown 
Voltage Trace Demo
==================

This is a repository that analyses simulated voltage traces for the purposes
of demonstrating data science methods and tools.


```
Now we can make our first commit.
```bash pwd=/bios611/my-project/
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added README. Initial commit."

```
Now we can actually push to our git repo. Let's create one. We do that by going to GitHub, creating a new repo, and then
following the instructions for pushing a new repo.

But first a few notes about ::ssh_keys:ssh, ssh keys, git remotes, etc.::
