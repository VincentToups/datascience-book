Updating Our Makefile
=====================

``` R file=basic_exploration.R

```

As usual our exercise is to find the inputs and outputs. 

:student-select:What are our inputs? What do we need to create the outputs?;../students.json::
:student-select:What are our outputs?;../students.json::

``` txt command="grep ggsave basic_exploration.R"

```

``` txt command="grep write_csv basic_exploration.R"

```

``` txt command="grep make_logger basic_exploration.R"

```



``` makefile file=Makefile

```

Now let's see if we can do a little bit more analysis. Maybe make a figure. Let's focus on ::05_states:American states::.
