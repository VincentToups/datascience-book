About This Exercise
===================

We're going to examine the data I've scraped from NUFORC (the National
UFO Reporting Center).

I do not believe that UFOs are alien craft, for the record. The
vastness of space is too foribidding when stacked up against my
understanding of general relativity to make that a plausible
explanation. 

Therefore, I think these sightings have at least two possible
explanations. They either represent a modestly coherent cultural or
even biological phenomenon (my wife's great grandfather experienced a
luminous entity which he chalked up to an angelic visitation) and/or
they represent normal metereological or aeuronautical phenomena that
are, as the name implies, poorly identified.

Let's see if we can figure this out.

Note: someone might like to do this as a data science project:

What we are going to do here is go through a process of creating a
project as I would do it, with a bit of an emphasis on structure that
might be somewhat cartoonish, but will hopefully make the ideas in the
class more clear.

Tidying Our Data
================

We begin, as always, getting situated with our dataset.

:table:source_data/nuforc_sightings.csv::

:schema:source_data/::

Makefile
========

Let's begin with some basic analysis.

``` makefile

exploration.md: source_data/nuforc_sightings.csv basic_exploration.R
	Rscript basic_exploration.R

```

Why write the make target first? It helps focus the mind. As you will
see we will end up with some significant changes to our Makefile before we are done.

Let's start with some basic utilities. In a real project we'd probably move these to 
some library-style utilities code.
``` R file=basic_exploration.R start="lit:library" end="lit:log(\"="

```

What this does is allow us to concisely write out logs. 

:student-select:Where does the logging function get its filename to write to?; ../students.json::

Now that we can log easily, let's get to thinking about examining and cleaning up
our data. We start with some basic diagnostic information.

``` R file=basic_exploration.R start="lit:d <- read_csv" end="^}"

```

After looking at this stuff by hand for a bit we can make a few more log entries:

``` R file=basic_exploration.R start="lit:log(\"\\n\\nMAD" end="lit:d <- d %>%"

```

Now we get to the real hard stuff: dealing ::02_date_and_time:with date and time::.
