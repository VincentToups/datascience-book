It is often the case that we need to think about how things are normalized.

In this data set we want to know how UFO sightings vary over state, but 
states have very different populations. So what we were looking at in the previous plot
is the population of the states (probably). The only way we can tell for sure
is to normalize the numbers by state population.

Consider this:

``` R file=get_pop_data.R

```
