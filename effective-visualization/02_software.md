Use the Right Software
======================

> Effective visuals typically require good command of one or more
> software. In other words, it might be unrealistic to expect complex,
> technical, and effective figures if you are using a simple spreadsheet
> program or some other software that is not designed to make complex,
> technical, and effective figures. Recognize that you might need to learn
> a new software---or expand your knowledge of a software you already
> know. While highly effective and aesthetically pleasing figures can be
> made quickly and simply, this may still represent a challenge to some.
> However, figure making is a method like anything else, and in order to
> do it, new methodologies may need to be learned. You would not expect to
> improve a field or lab method without changing something or learning
> something new. Data visualization is the same, with the added benefit
> that most software is readily available, inexpensive, or free, and many
> come with large online help resources.

I would add to this only the following notes:

1. In this class, the right software is almost always "ggplot."
2. In general, there is no such thing as the right softwareâ€”you should be intrepid in your pursuit of whatever
technical solutions are useful to your ends.
3. The "right" software is usually something that conceptualizes the domain in a way that is simple enough
but no simpler. ggplot knows that, fundamentally, we connect data and geometry together when we make plots. It knows that the standard plot types are expressions of that idea, but not the boundaries of it.
