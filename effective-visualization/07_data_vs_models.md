He also suggests detailed captions. But I would caution you: if your captions are getting long
it might be a sign that you need to reconsider your plot.

I feel similarly about "infographics" (his principle 9). In general, I
think "infographics" are bad unless your purpose is to dazzle or bamboozle.

Or if you are trying to show a domain expert something in a form they
can digest completely.

My advice is that if you think you need an infographic it might be
because you aren't willing to push your tools a bit and think outside
of the box.

His final advice is "get an opinion."

This doesn't hurt. Ask me, ask someone, but never just throw a figure at your
audience without testing it ahead of time.
