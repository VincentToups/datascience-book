Showing More
============

Sometimes we have to change our perspective on a dataset.

What if we calculated the amount of dialog *per episode* instead of over the entire
datasetâ€”that would show a lot more interesting information.

``` R file=better_geom.R

```
We can pack even more into the plot with a violin plot:

``` R file=geom_violin.R

```
Can we do even better?

Arguably: we have more than just dialog counts; we also have the length of each 
section of dialog. That is probably more informative.
