# Dimensionality Reduction

These are precisely the circumstances in which dimensionality
reduction is appropriate. We have a data set which is encoded in a
highly redundant way and we want a lower dimensional representation so
that we can either do some subsequent modeling with it or otherwise
understand its nature.

Meditate for a moment on this fact: the universe is *much much much*
simpler than its apparent degrees of freedom suggest it could be. An
absolutely central question in contemporary cosmology is *why* is the
universe so simple? Why is the entropy of the past so much lower than
that of the future when in general we expect entropy to be high if time
is involved?

There are many ways to approach this problem but the most common one is:
